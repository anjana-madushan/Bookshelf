# Bookshelf App
The Bookshelf App is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with MySQL, React, and Node.js, designed to manage and organize books efficiently. This project serves as a hands-on example to demonstrate how to connect a relational database (MySQL) to a full-stack application, highlighting key operations such as data insertion, retrieval, modification, and deletion.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a learning experience in integrating relational databases with a modern tech stack. It showcases how to:

Set up a MySQL database for relational data storage.
Build a RESTful API with Node.js and Express for backend data management.
Use React for creating a dynamic and user-friendly frontend interface.
Handle database operations (CRUD) seamlessly through API endpoints.
This app is ideal for beginners who want to understand the fundamental concepts of full-stack development and database management.

Features
Add new books to the collection with attributes such as title, author, genre, and publication year.
View a comprehensive list of all books in the database.
Edit book details to keep the information accurate and up-to-date.
Delete books that are no longer needed in the collection.
